## How to use:
1. Click on the green "clone or download zip" button, and download the files as a zip.

  ![zip](https://puu.sh/ssS7x/c7fded7742.png)
2. Navigate to your downloads folder, find the file "rangecalculator-master.zip", right click it and extract the files.
	2a. Rename the folder "rangecalculator-master" to "rangecalculator"
3. Open up your web browser, open a new tab, and press control + o. (alternatively, you can click file > open file on the top left [if your browser has that])
4. Navigate to where you extracted the files earlier, and select "calculator.html". Open it.
5. If everything went okay, you should now see our calculator. It works better on wider monitors.
6. On MS, take off all your character cards, or the calculations will be inaccurate.
7. Fill out the entire form, and make sure that the correct class and weapon choice is selected, and that every box is filled in with a number or 0.
8. Click calculate. It should match up with what you see in-game. Now you can experiment to see how your range changes if you swap out equipment, or if say you get another star on a tyrants piece. Boss Damage, Crit and IED calculations will come later.
