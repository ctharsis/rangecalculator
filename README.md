## Notes
- Decided to not add character cards 
  - The range you gain from character cards are minimal, and as a whole does not contribute much to your range
  - Character cards usually serve as a boost to important stats such as boss, IED/PDR, crit rate, crit damage, etc
  - New Maple Union system replacing current character card system
