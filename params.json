  "body": "# Maplestory 1 Clean Range Calculator\r\n\r\n## Currently supported classes:\r\n- Aran\r\n- Bishop\r\n- Bowmaster\r\n- Dark Knight\r\n- Demon Slayer\r\n- Evan\r\n- Fire/Poison Archmage\r\n- Hero\r\n- Ice/Lightning Archmage\r\n- Kaiser\r\n- Kanna\r\n- Kinesis\r\n- Luminous\r\n- Mercedes\r\n- Night Lord\r\n- Phantom\r\n- Shade/Eunwol\r\n- Wind Archer\r\n- Xenon\r\n\r\n## How to use:\r\n1. Click on the green \"clone or download zip\" button, and download the files as a zip.\r\n\r\n  ![zip](https://puu.sh/ssS7x/c7fded7742.png)\r\n2. Navigate to your downloads folder, find the file \"rangecalculator-master.zip\", right click it and extract the files.\r\n3. Open up your web browser, open a new tab, and press control + o. (alternatively, you can click file > open file on the top left [if your browser has that])\r\n4. Navigate to where you extracted the files earlier, and select \"calculator.html\". Open it.\r\n5. If everything went okay, you should now see our calculator. It works better on wider monitors.\r\n6. On MS, take off all your character cards, or the calculations will be inaccurate.\r\n7. Fill out the entire form, and make sure that the correct class and weapon choice is selected, and that every box is filled in with a number or 0.\r\n8. Click calculate. It should match up with what you see in-game. Now you can experiment to see how your range changes if you swap out equipment, or if say you get another star on a tyrants piece. Boss Damage, Crit and IED calculations will come later.\r\n\r\n## To-Do list\r\n- [ ] Finish adding every class\r\n- [x] Boss Damage\r\n- [x] Crit\r\n- [ ] IED\r\n- [ ] Character Cards\r\n- [ ] Hayato range calculation is weird.\r\n\r\n## Potential features\r\n- Deploy onto a site for easier usage\r\n  - Save/Load/Import/Export feature\r\n- Compare feature\r\n- Skill damage calculation and theoretical DPS\r\n  - Attack speed inclusion\r\n- Calculations for a range increase per 1% stat\r\n",
